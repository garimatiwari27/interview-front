## Homework

Imagine you're building a website for a portfolio, and you want to have a profile card element that
can be configured and reused easily, it's interactive and of course pretty.
- Implement a custom HTML element: Profile card -> &lt;profile-card> &lt;/profile-card>
    - Use Vanilla JS, CSS and HTML for your component
    - Add tests for the element, you can use selenium or follow a more challenging approach doing unit tests for it.
    - What if you wanted it to preserve its own styling among websites?

## Recommendations & tips   

- Consider creating a branch and storing your work there
- Use your imagination and feel free to ask questions

## Solution
Below is the guide to execute the solution and softwares required to execute the codebase.

## Software Installation
The following are the pre-requisites to edit and execute the codebase:

     3. All the required dependencies are mentioned in pom.xml

## Demonstration
To access the HTML portfolio, the entry point is the "**index.html**" file. Open this file with Live server inside VS Code for the demo.

## Testing
To execute test cases, open the project "**SeleniumTesting**" inside the testing folder in eclipse and build the project.
Just run the tests in the file "src/test/java/ui/TestAutomationClass.java" and check out the test report in the console or test-output folder.
